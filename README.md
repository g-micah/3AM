# 3am
This web application is a "freelancer" job posting and searching site. It utilizes PHP and a MySQL database to implement account, profile, and job posting management. The idea behind the name is that though this, you can find help and services even at '3AM'. This web application is not the most aesthetically pleasing, but is built with full functionality on the 'Home', 'Profile', 'Post Listings', and 'Log Out' tabs. 

'u836136612_CISCapstone.sql' is a script to re-create the database.
